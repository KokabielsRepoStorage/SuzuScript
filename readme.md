# The future Of this
## Two versions
### Interpreted
The interpreted version is going to be harder to develop. Not only do I need to manually find all of the keywords, I have to make everything the way I need it to manually. The better part about a compiled / transpiled language is that the majority of it is (thankfully) taken off of me through them having a fully fledged language.<br><br>
**The interpreted one is going to be harder to make, but might be more intuative.**

### Compiled
This one is the easier one. I have choices on what I can do without having to make a parser and everything.<br>
the main problem is, which language to compile to? <br>
Here are my two ideas :<br>
**Rust**<br>
It will be faster once compiled, and a pretty nice language. One small problem though. I don't know much about rust<br><br>
**Javascript / Typescript**<br>
This one will be easier, since I already know the language.<br>
<br>

### Solution :
I am going to try both.<br>
**I am going to make the JS / TS one first**<br>
Then rust, since for rust I have to make an entire file system too. For js I can just take a src and convert it to the dist folder.<br><br><br>


## Final thoughts : 
There will be 3 different file extensions : <br>
**.suzu** : Going to be the **Interpreted version**<br>
**.jsuzu** : Going to be the **JS Compiled version**<br>
**.rsuzu** : Going to be the **Rust Compiled version**<br>
<br>

**This probably will be the language that will replace the js / ts in the discord bot, just to show I can make a fully fledged language. The icon and the language highlighting will be made at some point**
